        <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>Alhamdulillah was salamu ala rasulillah. Wa ala alihi wa ashabihi wa man walah.</p>
            <p>The first revelation that was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the cave of Hera was: Read in the name of your Lord Who created. He created man from a clot. Surely your Lord is Merciful. Who taught through the pen. He taught man what he did not know (Surah Al-Alaq, verses 1-5).</p> 
            <P>Just as worldly education is necessary to maintain the rules and management of the world, so is religious education necessary for the protection of the religion and for all the affairs of the world to be in accordance with the pleasure of Allah. In order for all classes of people in the Muslim society to be able to follow the religion and live a halal life free from haram, it is essential to have a Jamaat that is proficient in the Qur'an and Sunnah. In the Qur'an, it has been said, "Why does not a party come out from every community, so that they may attain Tafakkuh of the religion and show fear to their people when they return to them?" Perhaps they will attain the fear of Allah (Surat at-Tawba, verse 122).</P>
            <p>In order to open up various opportunities for the practice of knowledge, RSS is offering a number of short courses in addition to the Alim course.</p> 
            <p>RSS is an open learning platform for acquiring Islamic education and knowledge in Bengali.</p> 
            <p>Apart from classical Islamic education, various term courses on study, dawah and linguistic skills will be offered here. There are skilled and experienced senior teachers at the university and madrasa level as instructors in this course.</p> 
            <p>Finally,
            Allaah says in the Qur'aan: Say, those who know and those who do not know; Can they be equal? Only those who are intelligent learn (Surah Jumar, verse no. 9).</p>
           <p>Let us not join the group of ignorant people. May Allah accept us for teaching religion.</p>
